/* To do:
 Programming part:
    -Write .csv/.txt -file with initialvalues for ~ 20-30 objects we want to consider with lines like: x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, m, r;
    -include massless (0.0) test object in Input.csv
    -Test 1d integrators for different functions and determine order of convergence with log-log-plot
    -calculate E_tot, E_pot, E_kin in driver functions and output them for conservation plot
    -calculate L_tot in driver functions and output it for conservation plot
    -calculate Laplace integral in driver functions and output it for conservation plot
    -implement adaptive stepsize control in the driver functions

    -Write a script for plots:
        -Energy
        -L
        -Laplace integral
        -trajectories in position space
        -trajectories in phase space
        (-trajectories in momentum space)
    -AnnÃ¤herungs effekte

    -Swing by maneuver, write code for:
	-reaching Jupiter -> determine the start
		velocity
		angle in perspective to Jupiter
		time it takes to reach Jupiter
	-once Jupiter is reached -> determine the start
		velocity
		angle needed to cross the pluto Trajectory

 Theoretical foundations:

    -idea of integrator schemes: from taylor-expansion to final formulas
    -representation of formulas in butcher tables and how to implement code from there
    -determining order of convergence (power laws) from log-log-plots
    (-post-newtonian/relativistic corrections)

 Latex:
	-personalize the template
	-define the structure and the order of topics and results
	-creating and chosing the plots for each topic
	-writing:
		-basics(integrators(euler, leapfrog, runge-kutta)
		-topic1
		-topic2
		-topic3
		-abstract
		-conclusion

 Other challenges:


  Test:
    -Unbeteiligte Planeten an/aus
    -Satellit losschicken und bei pluto ankommen
